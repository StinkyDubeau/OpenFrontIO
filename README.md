# Pressure Atlas

Pressure Atlas is a persistent multiplayer strategy game built as an
independent modified version of [OpenFront](https://github.com/openfrontio/OpenFrontIO).
It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or an official product of OpenFront
Inc. This repository was modified by StinkyDubeau in 2026.

The inherited OpenFront strategy simulation remains focused on territorial
control, structures, alliances, and real-world geography. Pressure Atlas adds
its own product identity, interface, and persistent multiplayer foundation.

This is a fork/rewrite of WarFront.io. Credit to https://github.com/WarFrontIO.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Strategy Gameplay**: Expand your territory and engage in strategic battles
- **Alliance System**: Form alliances with other players for mutual defense
- **Multiple Maps**: Play across various geographical regions including Europe, Asia, Africa, and more
- **Resource Management**: Balance your expansion with defensive capabilities
- **Cross-platform**: Play in any modern web browser

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v10.9.2 or higher)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openfrontio/OpenFrontIO.git
   cd OpenFrontIO
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm run inst
   ```

   Do NOT use `npm install` nor `npm i` but instead use our `npm run inst`. It runs the safer `npm ci --ignore-scripts` to install dependencies exactly according to the versions in `package-lock.json` and doesn't run scripts. This can prevent being hit by a supply chain attack.

## 🎮 Running the Game

### Development Mode

Run both the client and server in development mode with live reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:

- Start the webpack dev server for the client
- Launch the game server with development settings
- Open the game in your default browser (to disable this behavior, set `SKIP_BROWSER_OPEN=true` in your environment)

### Client Only

To run just the client with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run start:client
```

### Server Only

To run just the server with development settings:

```bash
npm run start:server-dev
```

### Connecting to staging or production backends

Sometimes it's useful to connect to production servers when replaying a game, testing user profiles, purchases, or login flow.

> To replay a production game, make sure you're on the same commit that the game you want to replay was executed on, you can find the `gitCommit` value via `https://api.openfront.io/game/[gameId]`.
> Unfinished games cannot be replayed on localhost.

To connect to staging api servers:

```bash
npm run dev:staging
```

To connect to production api servers:

```bash
npm run dev:prod
```
